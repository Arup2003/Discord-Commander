# Discord-Commander
Hello! This is a dank memer automating program, which will automatically type commands in discord on your behalf.

Although this is meant to be used in discord, this is not just limited to that. You can automate any task which requires constant messaging

## How to start
- Clone the repository and run `discord_commander.py`
- **The GUI folder and discord_commander.py should be in the same destination.**

## Pre-Requisites
- PYTHON
- win32api (`pip install pywin32`)
- pyautogui (`pip install pyautogui`)

## How to use:
- Enter your commands to be issued in the space given (Basic dank memer commands are pre inputted)
- Choose if your want to use horseshoe at the interval of every 15 minutes. (it will type `pls buy hoe` and `pls use hoe`)
- Enter the interval between typing each command. (16 is pre-inputted)
- Click `Next`
- Place the next window in a corner of the screen and open discord (Or any app where you want to type the commands). 
- Right click on the message box and then click `Calibrate`
- Now it should display the time the program has run for, number of messages sent and *XP gained in `MEE6` or `Arcane`*

## Issues and Force Stop:
If you want to force stop the program, quickly move the mouse cursor to to bottom left corner of the screen. This can be required if you choose the time interval to be around 1/2 seconds.
